# Gravity Balls 🎱🌌

**Gravity Balls** is a physics-based 3D simulation project built using **OpenGL** and **GLUT**, where multiple balls move under the influence of **gravity**, **friction**, and **collision dynamics**. This project is a fun and interactive way to visualize basic physics in action using graphical rendering.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Realistic gravity-based motion simulation  
- ✅ Collision detection and response between balls  
- ✅ Boundary collisions with wall rebound effects  
- ✅ Frictional slowdown to simulate energy loss  
- ✅ Rendered using `glutSolidSphere` in a 3D space

## 🚀 How to Use

### 🔹 Build from Source (Using Visual Studio)

1. Download all the files on your computer.
1. Open `GravityBalls.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Make sure your system has OpenGL and GLUT libraries set up (Visual Studio should handle this if you're using the included files).
3. Press `Ctrl + F5` to build and run.

## ❓ Controls

The simulation starts automatically, but you can **interact and modify parameters in real time** using the following keyboard shortcuts:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `2` / `8` | Decrease / Increase Gravity |
| `4` / `6` | Decrease / Increase Friction |
| `A` / `D` | Decrease / Increase Elasticity |
| `Q` / `E` | Decrease / Increase Entropy |
| `<` / `>` | Decrease / Increase Time Scale |
| `N` | Add New Balls |
| `M` | Toggle Magnetize Walls |
| `B` | Toggle Black Hole Mode |
| `G` | Toggle Cursor Gravity |
| `+` / `-` | Zoom In/Out |
| `SPACE` | Pause/Play |
| `R` | Reset |
| `C` | Clear |
| `ESC` | Quit |
| (Shown on top of simulation window) | Real-time updated values: Gravity, Friction, Elasticity, Ball Count, Entropy, Time Scale, etc. |

You can also customize the **number of balls** and **initial settings** directly in `main.cpp` before compiling.

> 🧪 Feel free to experiment with combinations to see how the environment reacts!
